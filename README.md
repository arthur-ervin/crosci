# crosci

A quick way to install and run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m crosci.demo

```

The file under crosci/demo.py contains an example of how to run the code on a white noise signal. This you can adapt to your own scenario.

The toolbox currently contains 2 biomarkers: DFA and fE/I. 

More extensive documentation soon to be released, as well as pip package.
